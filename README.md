### Workflow for Assignment and Project Submissions

Assignments will be submitted via github, using git and the free github education service. Make sure you 
have a github account.

Make sure your name is properly displayed (such as Ahmet Mehmet and not ahmtmht)

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

Enabling `Edit`->`Automatically Sync after Committing` is recommended. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository for the posted assignment. This will create a copy of the original repository under your account. This copy will be still logically linked to the posted assignments repository.
1. Clone the repository to your computer. You will work on this copy at your local machine.
1. Modify the files to complete your solution.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed. 
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository. This is when you actually submit your work.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the deadline â€“ just add a comment in the pull request to let us know what has been updated.
